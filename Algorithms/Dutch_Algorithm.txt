//sorting an array if array contains only 0's,1's,2's (sorting.cpp)
Dutch National Flag Algorithm: 
This algorithm states that
1] everything from [0 to low-1] is 0 -------->Extreme left
2] everything from [low to mid-1] is 1
3] everything from [high+1 to n-1] is 2 ---------->Extreme right



0          low-1         low         mid-1             mid            high          high+1              n-1
