//Majority_element.cpp

Let’s say arr[] = {2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}

Phase 1: Finding Candidate
Initialize candidate = None, count = 0

For each element:

If count == 0: set candidate = element

If element == candidate: count++

Else: count--

This phase gives us a potential majority candidate.

Phase 2: Verifying Candidate
Count the actual occurrences of the candidate in the array.

If count > ⌊n/2⌋ → it's the majority.

Else → No majority element.
